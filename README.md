# React News Portal

React News Portal is a frontend project that enables users to view recent news on their preferred devices. It supports functionalities like searching, filtering news according to categories, remembering your favorite news, and showing it afterwards whenever you want.

## Overview

React News Portal is designed to provide users with a seamless news browsing experience. With a clean and responsive interface, users can easily search for news articles, filter them based on their interests, and save their favorite articles for later viewing. The application leverages the power of React and Redux to deliver a robust and efficient user experience.

## Features

- **Search News**: Quickly find news articles by entering keywords in the search bar.
- **Filter by Categories**: Narrow down news articles by selecting from a range of categories.
- **Save Favorite News**: Mark articles as favorites and access them anytime.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience on any device, whether it's a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
